# Raindrop-Sensor

 -- Introduction --
 
The raindrop sensor is an analog-type sensor that effectively measures changes in resistance when it encounters water.

This property makes it an ideal choice for detecting rain and water presence in various applications.

While typically designed with two pins, there are also versions available with a controller module, effectively converting it into a three-pin sensor for enhanced functionality.
